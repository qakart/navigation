# Navigation
This visualization is used to dynamically show dashboard links within dashboards to facilitate better navigation.
Features Include:
- Filter Dashboards by Prefix (Case Sensitive: lowercase only).
- Truncating first few characters in Dashboard Names using a delimiter.
- Sorting Links based on Dashboard title (Even if you use Description for Hyperlinks).
- Upper limit for number of links to show.
- Using Description rather than Dashboard name for Hyperlinks.
- Works well with X-Pack or other Security Plugins with limited dashboard access.
